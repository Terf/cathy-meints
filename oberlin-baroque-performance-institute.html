          <p>Catharina Meints Caldwell wrote and produced this IBook to chronicle the history of BPI as it is known. The Institute was started in 1972 by James Caldwell in order to bring August Wenzinger to the USA to perform, teach and conduct. Catharina was very much involved in the early years and continues to be the senior faculty member 47 years later. She limited this memoir to the years 1972-1983 when Wenzinger was music director. Caldwell and Meints had preserved many of the administrative records and they were an important source for gathering information and jogging memory.</p>

          <p>The main reason for accepting the challenge to create this work was the unexpected opportunity to hear and preserve a number of recordings that the faculty made in the late 1970's that were never released. Others still existed on LP but had not been reissued on CD. She was able to "embed" a number of tracks in the book but there was much more music to be heard. The equivalent of 16 CD's is now available on this website. The tracks have been arranged by country of origin and is roughly chronological.</p>
